# Accessibility Design and User Experience  
Jiawei Zhao


Faced with different user groups, products need to be warming and to meet the needs of different user groups. The realization of barrier-free design can allow products to take into account more diversified use scenarios, improve user experience, and help themselves improve the usability and practicality of products.

## Introduction

The concept of accessibility was created in 1974 by the United Nations organization. The ideal goal of accessibility is "barrier-free", which encourages the public to pay more attention to disabled people and the elderly.

People think about disability generally refers to some obvious permanent disabilities, such as blindness, deafness, and wheelchair mobility. The number of persons with disabilities is related to one-third of households in the country. The population of the disabled is really large.

In addition to these people, the concept of "disability" actually exists widely. For example, when you hold a heavy object with both hands, you cannot use your fingers to touch the screen; or there are some obstructions on your face and the facial recognition function cannot be used. These are situational disabilities or temporary disabilities. Everyone encounters these situational and temporary obstacles almost every day.

There are four main aspects of barrier-free design in web accessibility:  

    1. Visually accessible design
    2. We have a wide scope of visual barriers. Symptoms of poor vision include blurred vision, hazy vision, high hyperopia or nearsightedness, color blindness, and tube vision. Visually impaired people sometimes have difficulty seeing text or images on the computer screen and performing tasks that require eye and hand cooperation (such as moving a computer mouse).
    3. Hearing accessible design
    4. Hearing impairment, also known as impaired hearing, refers to a complete or partial decrease in the ability to sense or understand sounds.
    5. Mobile accessible design
    6. Mobility obstacles include users who cannot operate the mouse, keyboard, or touch screen, as well as physically handicapped users in general.
    7. Cognitive accessible design
    8. Cognitive impairment includes memory, learning or language ability, attention, emotional control, etc. Cognitive impairment means that users may need assistive technology to help them read text.

## Visual Accessibility

Human beings are integrated bodies that need several components to work together, such as vision, hearing, and touch. Among these components, barrier-free color design is a visual design system for all the public. The final goal of the system is to create a barrier-free visual environment and supply people with the maximum information. The basic idea of barrier-free design is to remove the barriers that make users feel confused and difficult on the user interface and to provide users with the greatest possible convenience.

There are two main types of visual impairment: 
One is the obstacles caused by low vision, which are divided into total blindness and amblyopia according to the degree of visual impairment; The other type is color vision recognition disorder. We usually call this group of people "Color Blindness" (also known as Dalton's disease, lack of color vision, color vision recognition disorder, color weakness, etc.)

Most people think that traffic lights might be the biggest problem for color blindness. This might not be accurate. The color of the traffic lights might not be a big problem. Because the color of lights is always arranged in a certain order, which makes it available for color blind people to recognize.

However, in daily life, people with color blindness still have some real obstacles:

    • It is not possible to tell whether the meat is cooked or not by its color.
    • There is no difference between the colors of blank (green) and occupied (red).
    • Flowers and fruits cannot be easy to find sometimes.
    • It is not known whether the fruit or vegetable is ripe or immature.
    • So far, color maps and graphics can sometimes be difficult to understand and understand.

We can follow the following ideas to find solutions:

    • Use multiple visual variables to express information at the same time;
    • Use color with both brightness and saturation, especially when using red; 
    • The visual information is not completely distinguished by color, while text and icons are used for annotation.

We will illustrate some applications of these solutions in actual design.

## Examples of Visual Accessibility Design

1. Map application

Red-green color blindness has caused the attention of Map apps to the visual impairment of color maps.

The barrier-free color matching of the Map app is selected and produced by referring to the visual color spectrum of the red-green blind people, establishing a unique "color matching logic" that is convenient for special people to understand. After switching the color vision accessibility mode, the color vision accessibility map displayed in the red-green color blindness simulation view is no different from the original view, which perfectly meets the reading needs of the red-green color blind people.


2. iChat—help color-blind users through graphics

People with color blindness should avoid the situation of conveying important information only in color, not distinguishing visual information completely by color, and using multiple visual variables to express information at the same time (such as shape + color, size + color, annotation + color). Among them, shape includes such usable elements: circles, triangles, rectangles, etc.; solid lines, dashed lines, dotted lines, etc.; letters, number symbols, etc.

In ichat's optimized interface design, the principle followed is: use as few colors as possible-combining symbols with different shapes and a small number of bright colors, the effect is far better than using only one shape and multiple colors. Therefore, the optimized and improved interface can transmit enough information, even if there is no color. For example, when a person who is completely color blind is browsing the interface, the interface will not lose any information.

## Summary

Only when the designer understands the types of visually accessible and the cognitive impairments of the color-impaired people, will they know what color scheme can avoid obstacles, and what kind of design can meet the needs of such hidden users.

In addition to the research and exploration of interface color matching, we can even provide a separate color-blind mode switch for color-blind people, which can also take into account the visual beauty and avoid too much information interference. This form also has precedents in games and software. 

We should broaden our horizons and minds, and think about our products and designs from a more tolerant and lofty position, not just for people with color vision disorders, we should unearth more users with obstacles hidden around us, explore more effective ways and methods to improve the efficiency of their interaction with the modern online world.
